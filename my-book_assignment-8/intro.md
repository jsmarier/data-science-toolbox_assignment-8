# Welcome to your Jupyter Book

This Jupyter Book is my capstone project for FS041F22O The Data Science Toolbox. This course is part of the [Key Capabilities in Data Science](https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/programs/key-capabilities-data-science) program offered by UBC Extended Learning.

In this Jupyter Book, I will compare the skills and techniques I learned throughout this program to the Google Sheets-based data analysis workflow I currently use with my own student at the University of Ottawa and Carleton University.
