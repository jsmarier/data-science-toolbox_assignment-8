# Welcome to My Jupyter Book for Assignment 8

This Jupyter Book is my capstone project for FS041F22O The Data Science Toolbox. This course is part of the [Key Capabilities in Data Science](https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/programs/key-capabilities-data-science) program offered by UBC Extended Learning.

In this Jupyter Book, I will compare the skills I learned through the four courses of this program to the current Google Sheets-based data analysis workflow I use with my own students at the University of Ottawa and Carleton University.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.
