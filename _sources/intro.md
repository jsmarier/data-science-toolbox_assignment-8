# Welcome to JS Marier's Jupyter Book

Hello! My name is Jean-Sébastien Marier. I am both a data science student, and a digital journalism instructor at the University of Ottawa and Carleton University.

This Jupyter Book is my capstone project for FS041F22O The Data Science Toolbox. This course is part of the [Key Capabilities in Data Science](https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/programs/key-capabilities-data-science) program offered by UBC Extended Learning.

In this Jupyter Book, I will compare the skills and techniques I learned throughout this program to the Google Sheets-based data analysis workflow I currently use with my own student in the following data-related courses:

- University of Ottawa: JOU4100 Digital Journalism II
- University of Ottawa: JOU4500 Journalisme numérique II
- Carleton University: MPAD2003 Introductory Data Storytelling

In my teaching, I loosely follow the three prong approach found in *[The Data Journalism Handbook 1: How journalists can use data to improve the news](https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook/one)* by {cite:ts}`data_handbook`:

1. Getting Data
1. Understanding Data
1. Delivering Data

In the following pages, I will demonstrate how my new Python and data science skills measure up against the Google-Sheets workflow I use for each of these steps.

For this "Proof of concept," I will use the same dataset I assigned to my students a few weeks ago for their data analysis project.

**Disclaimer:** Throughout this assignment, I reused and customized chunks of code from some of my previous final projects for this program, as well as techniques thought in the various modules of all four courses offered through the program.

```{warning}
I encountered an unknown "parsing" error when importing my dataset with pd.read_csv. Therefore, the depth of my data analysis in this assignment is rather limited. I hope that I nonetheless managed to showcase some of my new skills, such as creating a Jupyter Book and deploying it via GitHub Pages.
