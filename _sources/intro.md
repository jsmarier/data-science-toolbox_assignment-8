# Welcome to JS Marier's Jupyter Book

This Jupyter Book is my capstone project for FS041F22O The Data Science Toolbox. This course is part of the [Key Capabilities in Data Science](https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/programs/key-capabilities-data-science) program offered by UBC Extended Learning.

In this Jupyter Book, I will compare the skills and techniques I learned throughout this program to the Google Sheets-based data analysis workflow I currently use with my own student at the University of Ottawa and Carleton University.

I am currently teaching the following data-related courses:

- University of Ottawa: JOU4100 Digital Journalism II
- University of Ottawa: JOU4500 Journalisme num√©rique II
- Carleton University: MPAD2003 Introductory Data Storytelling

In my teaching, I loosely follow the three prong approach found in *[The Data Journalism Handbook 1: How journalists can use data to improve the news](https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook/one)*:

1. Getting Data
1. Understanding Data
1. Delivering Data

In the following pages, I will demonstrate how my new Python and data science skills measure up against the Google-Sheets workflow I use for each of these steps.

For this "Proof of concept," I will reuse chuncks of code from my final project I submitted in May 2021 for the Data Visualization course.

Here are the main sections of this Jupyter Lab:
